# Homework - Covid-19 Analysis on GCP
Homework of Cloud Computing and Big Data Course

The COVID-19 pandemic of 2019-2020 is the current pandemic of the so-called “new coronavirus disease“, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. 
Patients experience flu-like symptoms such as dermatitis, fever, dry cough, tiredness, difficulty breathing. In the most serious cases, often found in subjects already burdened by previous pathologies, pneumonia develops, acute renal failure, up to even death.
<br>Patients also have leukopenia and lymphocytopenia. A test to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection has been available since mid-January 2020, but specific treatments and vaccines are currently being researched and tested.
<br>The healings are spontaneous and the treatments are mainly aimed at managing symptoms and supporting vital functions even if some antiviral drugs already used to contrast other infections have been tested. 
<br>The aim of this project is to analyze data about COVID-19 using Google Cloud Platform.
